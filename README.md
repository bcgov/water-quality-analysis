Water Quality Index (WQI) and Water Quality Trend Analyses at Selected Ambient Monitoring Stations in B.C.
==========================================================================================================

Usage
-----

### Data

### Code

There are nine core scripts that are required for the analysis, they need to be run in the order specified in `run_all.R`.

Currently the `run_all.R` script can't be `source`ed to run them all at once because the `01c_download_data.R` script requires interaction with the `rems` package.
